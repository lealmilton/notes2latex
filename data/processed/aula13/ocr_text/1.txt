## OBSERVATIONS ##
The content of the image appears to be the first page of handwritten notes from a mathematics course, focusing on the topic of "Controllability." The language of the notes is Portuguese. There are no graphs, drawings, or complex elements that are not distinguishable. The context of the content is related to linear dynamic systems, specifically the definition and conditions under which a system is considered controllable. The equation presented is a standard linear state-space representation of a dynamic system. The handwriting is relatively clear, but due to its handwritten nature, some letters might be interpreted differently by different people. There do not seem to be any omissions that will affect the transcription.

## ACTUAL TRANSCRIPTION ##
Controllabilidade

1) Defi:

Um Sistema

$\dot{x} = Ax + Bu$

$x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ -> Variáveis de estados

$u \in \mathbb{R}^r$ -> Variáveis de controle

é dito controlável se

para qualquer $a \in \mathbb{R}^n$ (condição inicial)

$b \in \mathbb{R}^n$ (condição final)

$T > 0$ é possível

encontrar uma função

$u : [0,T] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^r$

tal que

$x(0) = a$

e $x(T) = b$
